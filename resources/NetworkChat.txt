then they have a very large return
	
Luca Buratti	14.34
so I don't have to predict the strategy of thet player but just cut off the card that can increase his higher status. correct?
	
Aidan Snoswell	14.34
yeah
	
Luca Buratti	14.34
ok this is much more easyer
Christian Lyngbye forlod gruppechatten.
	
Aidan Snoswell	14.34
usually that is a players strategy, anyway
	
Luca Buratti	14.36
ok these was the most urgent question about AI. we'll send you some others minor question via e-mail in these days
	
Mike Stimson	14.36
awesome
networking now?
	
César Cornejo	14.37
we are disagree that AIT requeriments, that write about the tutorial, In our opinion is unnecesary, it is a table game and the board game isn´t a practice tutorial. We think that we give a good manual of game
	
Mike Stimson	14.39
we can lower the priority of that requirement
	
Andrew Priebe	14.39
perhaps tutorial could instead be more like a 'toggle' that the individuals players use, which makes more help tooltips appear during the course of the game
	
Luca Buratti	14.39
quote
	
César Cornejo	14.40
We agree with Andrew
	
Mike Stimson	14.41
we think that would be harder to implement
then a tutorial level
but if you want too :)
that will be changed then
	
Andrew Priebe	14.41
i think the ITU team is up to the challenge!
(my team)
regarding networking: what happens if a player loses their connection?
	
Mike Stimson	14.42
NFR006
	
Aidan Snoswell	14.43
page 65
	
Andrew Priebe	14.43
so the AI player would assume the exact state of the disconnected player?
	
Mike Stimson	14.44
yeh
after the timeout
	
Andrew Priebe	14.44
what do you suggest for timeout?
5-10 mins?
	
Sergai Person	14.44
Whatever seems reasonable to you
	
mig	14.45
can all players submit cards in parallel or is there a specific order?
	
Mike Stimson	14.45
most games have a votekick mechanic
parallel

Mike Stimson forlod gruppechatten.
	
Andrew Priebe	14.46
is there any mention of a votekick in the requirements? Otherwise that may be a good low priority one
	
Mike Stimson	14.46
there isn't at the moment
if that is how you would like to handel the issue we can add it
Mike Stimson forlod gruppechatten.
	
mig	14.47
If a player does not take action before the time runs out he is notified or the board will just update?
maybe there is a countdown alert pushed from the server?
I hope it is alright with everyone that we save this chat log to our own public github repository
	
Sergai Person	14.50
That is fine
	
Luca Buratti	14.50
great idea
USER_Mike Stimson deltager i gruppechatten.
	
Sergai Person	14.51
it
	
Aidan Snoswell	14.51
GUIAP (page 57) specifies what happens to a non-responsive player, but it doesn't currently mention any alert
	
César Cornejo	14.51
awesome

USER_Mike Stimson deltager i gruppechatten.
	
Sergai Person	14.54
Are there any more question?
Mike Stimson forlod gruppechatten.
	
Andrew Priebe	14.55
ITU is dome
done
	
Luca Buratti	14.55
Milano is done too
	
César Cornejo	14.55
we have one last
the discard pile
it's one for age?
or one for all 3
	
Aidan Snoswell	14.55
all 3
USER_Mike Stimson deltager i gruppechatten.
	
César Cornejo	14.55
great
	
Luca Buratti	14.56
but is it useful? Do I evere use the discard pile?
	
Aidan Snoswell	14.56
it's only ever used for two wonder effects
	
Luca Buratti	14.56
ok thank you
	
Aidan Snoswell	14.56
that let you do stuff with the discard pile
so it's not high priority
	
César Cornejo	14.56
ok we done thanks
	
Sergai Person	14.57
Ok then, if you have any more questions, just send us an email
	
Andrew Priebe	14.58
Adelaide: Just to clarify, are we sending updates the SRS to you, or have you been keeping track of what needs to be changed?
	
Mike Stimson	14.58
we have been keeping track
	
Luca Buratti	14.58

Andrew Priebe	14.58

mig	15.00
we cannot 25
	
Luca Buratti	15.00
the deadline is is 27...
	
César Cornejo	15.01
we cannot 26 we have to travel for elections
	
Aidan Snoswell	15.01
at least a couple of our team could be on pretty much any day
	
mig	15.01
I think each group should discuss their changes with Adelaide individually
	
Luca Buratti	15.02
ok so everyone will schedule a fast meeting with adelaide on their own?
	
mig	15.03
we can do tomorrow at 11 CET?
	
Mike Stimson	15.03
ok
umm
yeh we will be free tomorrow
want to do this over skype?
or is it easier to use hangout since we have it all set up now
	
Luca Buratti	15.05
I suggest to use this group to set up each meeting
	
Mike Stimson	15.06
kk
	
César Cornejo	15.06
we can't tomorrow but will send our issues if we have one
	
Luca Buratti	15.07
ok for Milano 1, in order to conclude, we'll send our mail about AI changes with attached some time and dates for last meeting with adelaide.
	
Mike Stimson	15.08
sounds good
	
César Cornejo	15.08
same for Rio Cuarto 3
	
mig	15.09
