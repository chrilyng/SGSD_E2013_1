since we all seem to have comunicatino problem I suggest to continue this conversatino via chat

yes we can't hear very well

we dont have
	
Mike Stimson	13.19
ah well
	
Luca Buratti	13.19
what about chat?
It's very hard to comunicate in this way
	
César Cornejo	13.20
continue we gonna try hear you
	
mig	13.20
I asked about difference in board sides
Mike will explain in text?
	
Mike Stimson	13.20
ok
	
César Cornejo	13.21
ok
	
Mike Stimson	13.21
the wonderboards are the playmats for each player
they provide a bonus reasource
and have stages which can be reaserched
each stage of research provides some sort of bonus
each wonder has an a side and a b side
the sides provide different resources and different bonus for researching stages
	
mig	13.22
luca can you please turn up microphone volume?
	
Mike Stimson	13.22
the b side is generally more complicated and for advanced players
	
Luca Buratti	13.22
ok wait a second becouse if we continue like this it's crazy to understand what we are doing.
	
Mike Stimson	13.23
it helps to think of a side and b side as two seperate wonder boards because u don't switch between them in one game
	
Luca Buratti	13.23
try to fix some steps
	
mig	13.23
cesar you are little to loud
	
César Cornejo	13.23
ok
	
Luca Buratti	13.23
e.g. 1st assign role
2nd question from each team
and 3rd misc.
	
César Cornejo	13.24
we agree
	
Mike Stimson	13.24
sure
	
mig	13.24
ok
	
Luca Buratti	13.24
so we have to develop: AI, GUI, logic and network
	
mig	13.24
we would like to do Logic
(ITU)
	
Luca Buratti	13.24
and 2 of them must be done by one group
	
César Cornejo	13.25
we too want the logic
	
Luca Buratti	13.25
we suggest to: 1 group logic, 1 group AI and 1 group gui + network since network is partially complete as I can understand
we would like to develop AI
what do you think about that?
	
César Cornejo	13.26
it's ok
	
Luca Buratti	13.26
nice
	
César Cornejo	13.27
we need to agree about the logic and gui
	
mig	13.27
how about Adelaide picks a number between 1 and 10! closest gets logic
	
Luca Buratti	13.27
ok let's try to understand the complexity of each part
	
Mike Stimson	13.28
is there any real way to choose? how many members does each group have?
	
Luca Buratti	13.28
Tio Cuarto u are in 5 right?
*rio
	
César Cornejo	13.28
yes
	
Luca Buratti	13.28
and ITU just 4 right?
	
mig	13.28
we are 4 in ITU
	
Luca Buratti	13.28
ok, which is the hardest part?
	
Mike Stimson	13.29
debatable :/
	
César Cornejo	13.29
we don't have experience in gui and many in logic
	
Luca Buratti	13.29
i think that the hardest part should be done by RIO Cuarto
	
César Cornejo	13.29
why?
	
Luca Buratti	13.29
beacause you are in 5
in team
we are in 3
and ITU 4
	
mig	13.29
ITU will take the high road and take GUI + Network
	
César Cornejo	13.30
it is a ewA
OK
so:
	
mig	13.30
ok, so that is settled. Perhaps now to questions about the SRS, what will the asking order be?4
	
Luca Buratti	13.30
ok so now that we know what are we going to do
we can discuss question separately
	
César Cornejo	13.31
so, Rio Cuarto: logic?
	
Luca Buratti	13.31
yes
	
César Cornejo	13.31
itu:gui+network?
and milan: AI?
	
Luca Buratti	13.31
an Milano AI
	
César Cornejo	13.31
ok
we agree
	
Luca Buratti	13.32
ok now
	
César Cornejo	13.32
continue whit opinions and changes in srs??
	
Luca Buratti	13.32
first GUI+network question
then AI question
and finally logic question
	
César Cornejo	13.32
ok
	
Luca Buratti	13.33
after questino let's try to review and correct SRS
	
César Cornejo	13.33
we agree
	
Luca Buratti	13.33
ITU your move
	
Mike Stimson	13.33
sure
	
mig	13.33
can we agree about some repository where we share resources (images) or we just put it in Github?
if so we need the images?
	
Luca Buratti	13.34
we agree but we don't know if is it legal for dose porject to use separate repositories
	
César Cornejo	13.35
the same of Luca
	
Mike Stimson	13.35
we will upload visual resources to github soon
or solve the problem some other way
the images are really large
but it will be our responsibility to supply the images

Luca Buratti forlod gruppechatten.
	
mig	13.38
the network architecture is just client/server? with game state saved on server?
the host player being the server
Luca Buratti forlod gruppechatten.
	
Mike Stimson	13.38
the requirements specify online multiplayer at the moment
but that may change
depending on how much of the networking is done for us
it would be too much work to do that from scratch
	
Aidan Snoswell	13.40
the architecture would probably be client/server. We should probably add that as a requirement
	
mig	13.40
are there any requirements for integrity for the game clients to avoid "hacking"?
USER_Luca Buratti deltager i gruppechatten.
	
mig	13.41
(security related)
	
Sergai Person	13.41
requirement NFR003, page 65
	
Luca Buratti	13.41
back
	
Sergai Person	13.42
Sorry, I meant page 64
	
Luca Buratti	13.42
sorry connection issues
	
mig	13.42
ok thx
but can you only see the neighbors boards and noone elses?
	
Mike Stimson	13.44
you can see every board
	
Aidan Snoswell	13.44
probably not all the time though, they wouldn't fit on the screen
	
Mike Stimson	13.44
however since u can only trade
with your neighbors
	
mig	13.45
next group for questions
	
César Cornejo	13.45
about GUI requeriments, we disagree with the next requeriments: GUIEM(separate coins into silver and golden coins isn't necesary),GUIET (isn´t necesary show divide the combats coins, only show as combate coins), GUIEB(isn´t necesary to show a back of a card).what do you think about this?
	
mig	13.45
thanks for the answers :)
	
Aidan Snoswell	13.45
The back of the cards are kinda important for showing that stages of a wonder have been built
	
Luca Buratti	13.46
can you explain this more in depth please?
	
Mike Stimson	13.46
the coins dont need the gold and silver denominations we agree
	
Aidan Snoswell	13.47
When you build a stage of a wonder, you place a card face down under that stage to show it's been built
you could use some other mechanism and do away with the backs of the cards, though
	
Luca Buratti	13.47
ok but this is a physical actino can't we just mark it somehow?
with an integer maybe?
Stage lvl 1,2,3,-
	
Aidan Snoswell	13.48
you could
it's kinda nice to see exactly the stages that have been built though, because they can have useful effects
maybe highlighting them as you build them?
	
Luca Buratti	13.49
ok so we can say that we have to highliht somehow which is the current stage of the wonder. the mecanism is choosen by GUI developer group
	
Mike Stimson	13.49
sure
	
Aidan Snoswell	13.50
yep
	
César Cornejo	13.50
ok, we agree
	
mig	13.50
sorry, I have a question about GUISP. How do you choose neighbor? You see their board and name?
	
César Cornejo	13.53
we think that every player location must be random because if they can choose brings some problems
	
Aidan Snoswell	13.53
yeah, we're just discussing that seperately
	
Sergai Person	13.53
You can decide how the neighbours will be chosen, however before the start of the game, each player must know about what players will be their neighbour
	
César Cornejo	13.53
ok
	
Mike Stimson	13.54
the important part is being able to see all the other player's board state
	
Aidan Snoswell	13.54
and where the other players are (as in, who's neighbours with who)
César Cornejo har inviteret personer til at deltage i videoopkaldet.
	
Mike Stimson	13.56
any more gui questions?
	
Luca Buratti	13.57
We think there is a major structural problem, the requiremens GUIAT, GUIAEB, GUIAET should be in the logic part instead of GUI.
	
mig	13.57
before we go on, I guess our group needs to do changes to the SRS document regarding GUI/Network for sunday?
	
Luca Buratti	13.58
no as far as we know is adelaide that have to update SRS
	
mig	13.58
I mean we agree on this...
	
Luca Buratti	13.59
we have no more question on GUI
	
César Cornejo	14.00
guieb it's no problem we do that with a feature
	
Mike Stimson	14.00
those gui requirements deal with the GUI side of implementing those functionalities. The logic underneath is addressed in the logic section
	
Luca Buratti	14.01
where?
	
Mike Stimson	14.01
the logic of GUIAT is addressed in LTBR page 13
	
Aidan Snoswell	14.01
yeah, those requirements deal specifically with the fact that there must be something in the gui that allows the players to choose to make those actions
	
Mike Stimson	14.02
logic of GUIAEB is addressed in WON05
and the rest of the wonder pages
52-54
	
Luca Buratti	14.03
yes but the tradeing mechanics aren't explained anywhere. e.g. can I refuse a tradeing offert? how many tradeing can I do each turn? If I buy something to player A, player A lose that item?
	
Mike Stimson	14.03
nothing so complicated
you cant refuse a trade
and the resource isnt taken
	
Luca Buratti	14.04
so trade is the wrong definition
	
Mike Stimson	14.04
think of the resource cards as structures that produce the resource
its still trading because the player gets the money
	
Luca Buratti	14.05
ok so trade is mandatory and act "clonieing" resources and the coin spent for trade go to the player who "sold" the item. correct?
	
Aidan Snoswell	14.05
yes
and all the resources remain after the turn as well
	
Mike Stimson	14.05
a better definition of that can be added
is there still any confusion about the trading?
	
Luca Buratti	14.08
I can repeat it untill I have coin?
	
Mike Stimson	14.09
only as much as they can supply
aswell
if they have one lumber yard you can only buy one wood resource per turn
	
Sergai Person	14.09
You do not trade away your resources for coins, you can only trade your coins away for the other players resources
	
Luca Buratti	14.10
ok should be clear now
